LearnToSolder 2019 Notes file

Build of first rev (v1) of board:
* Thermals too aggressive. Use traces on just one layer instead.
* Update LED footprint
  - Same sized pads on both top and bottom layers
  - Separate pads from each other for fewer solder bridges
* Create cutout for pin 1 dot for processor on tSilk somehow?
* Update silk on back 
  - larger/thicker text in general
  - Better build hints (line drawings of LED long lead and battery holder shape)
  - Glen Lake logo somehow?
* Possibly update silk on front - "Glen Lake"?
