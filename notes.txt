LearnToSolder 2019 Notes file

Build of first rev (v1) of board:
* Thermals too aggressive. Use traces on just one layer instead. (Done)
* Update LED footprint
  - Same sized pads on both top and bottom layers (Done)
  - Separate pads from each other for fewer solder bridges (Done)
* Create cutout for pin 1 dot for processor on tSilk somehow? (Done)
* Update silk on back 
  - larger/thicker text in general (Done)
  - Better build hints (line drawings of LED long lead and battery holder shape) (Done)
* Possibly update silk on front - "Glen Lake"? (Done)

(5/18/2019) V2 of the board was made with all of the above fixed
Blue solder mask

Things to improve for 2020:
* Do not use a ground plane. JLCPCB does not have good enough registration between the solder mask and the copper, so when kids use too much solder, it makes bridges between pins and GND.
* Do not pass out the pliers. They are not needed, and confuse the students.
* Use the document camera to live-demo soldering on the exact board they will solder on. Replace the microscope soldering video witht this.
